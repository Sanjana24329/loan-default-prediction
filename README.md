\# Loan Default Prediction using Machine Learning



This project predicts loan default risk using supervised machine learning techniques in Python.



\## Features

\- Data cleaning and preprocessing using Pandas and NumPy

\- Classification model trained using Scikit-learn

\- Predicts loan status as Low Risk or High Risk (Charged Off)

\- Includes sample frontend for user input



\## Technologies Used

\- Python

\- Pandas, NumPy

\- Scikit-learn

\- HTML, CSS, JavaScript

\- Git and GitHub



\## Dataset

The model is trained on a cleaned version of a publicly available loan dataset inspired by Lending Club data.



\## How to Run

1\. Clone the repository

2\. Install dependencies

3\. Run the Python scripts to train or test the model
